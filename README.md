# Netflix Content Analysis

## Project Overview

### Mindset

- **Attempt this case study** with a focus on learning and understanding. Evaluation will be kept lenient.
- **Read questions carefully** to understand what is being asked before jumping into solutions.
- **Brainstorm and troubleshoot** any issues you encounter; remember Google is your friend.
- **Revisit lectures or notes** if needed for clarity on specific topics.
- **Collaborate with peers** via Slack and WhatsApp, and seek guidance from your instructor for major issues.
- **Keep an open mind** – there’s often no single “right” answer. Developing the ability to work with uncertainty is part of the goal.

## About Netflix

Netflix is one of the most popular streaming platforms, hosting over 10,000 movies and TV shows. As of mid-2021, it has over 222 million subscribers worldwide. This dataset provides a tabular listing of movies and shows on Netflix, including details such as cast, directors, ratings, release years, and durations.

## Business Problem

The objective is to analyze the dataset and generate insights that could help Netflix determine:

1. **What type of shows/movies to produce**
2. **How to grow the business in different countries**

## Hints for Analysis

- **Define goals**: While exploring the data, aim to answer questions related to content type and business growth.
- **Back recommendations with data**: Use data-driven insights rather than personal opinions.
- **Keep explanations simple**: Assume the audience has a basic understanding of data science.
  
**Exploration Ideas**:
- Content availability by country
- Annual trends in movie releases over the last 20-30 years
- TV shows vs. movies comparison
- Ideal launch times for TV shows
- Analysis of actors/directors across different content types
- Netflix’s focus on TV Shows vs. movies in recent years
- Content availability by country



## Submission Process

1. **Document insights and recommendations** in a rich-text editor.
2. **Convert the Jupyter Notebook** to PDF (using Chrome’s “Save as PDF” print option).
3. **Upload the PDF to Google Drive** (set permissions for public access) and share the link.
4. Alternatively, **submit the PDF directly on the portal** if permitted.
5. Optionally, **add screenshots or graphs** to enhance explanations, using `plt.savefig(...)` for matplotlib plots.
